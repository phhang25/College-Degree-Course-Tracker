# College Degree Course Tracker
## https://phhang25.github.io/College-Degree-Course-Tracker/
## Description
### Add course requirements, course areas, and courses with statuses.
### Move cursor away from rectangles to cancel an action.
### Enter a course with a status. For example: "CSC 248 > in progress"
## What I learned
### I realized that I overestimated how much time it would take to design and implement new features. 
### However, the project helped me look at big daunting problems and break them down into smaller and more manageable parts.
### One of the hardest parts of developing the website was figuring out how the website would save user inputs so their data isn't just stored for one session and is then lost forever.
### However, I was able to solve this by using local storage to store course requirements, course areas, and courses with statuses as JavaScript Objects and parsing them as strings so that the elements could later be appended back onto the page using a for-loop when the user returns.
